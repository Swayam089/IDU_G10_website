        <center><h1>What should the Individuals do to improve the healthcare system of Chile?</h1></center>
        <center><p>I firmly think that tiny adjustments may result in significant adjustments. In a similar vein, we<br> must not undervalue the influence of an individual. We can all make a significant difference in <br>the healthcare system. The actions we can take to do that include giving additional lying <br>medications—that are also not expired—to other persons in need. We could all enter the<br> pharmaceutical industry, which would enable us to significantly advance the sector's <br>infrastructure and level of healthcare.A person may also enlighten the public about <br>healthcare issues, for instance through Instagram posts or posters, which might help <br>people understand why generic medications are preferable to name-brand ones. In order to <br>force the government to take prompt action for the ensuing issues, we should first declare <br>an emergency and stage protests or posts on social media accounts. One can also do <br>health care research and create novel medications that treat important global ailments like <br>cancer.
