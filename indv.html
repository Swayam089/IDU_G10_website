        <center><h1>What should the Individuals do to improve the healthcare system of Chile?</h1></center>
        <center><p>In my opinion, the government should improve access to healthcare for all citizens by expanding <br>
          the availability of insurance. We should also encourage the production of generic drugs because <br>
          doing so will likely result in a much faster decline in healthcare costs. In addition, we should<br>
           offer medical protection to all citizens of the nation. We should do this because many people <br>
          lack proper medical insurance, which could allow them to survive and receive timely care. We <br>
          also need to increase the availability of technology and invest heavily in R&D because, if we do, <br>we could be the nation that obtains a monopoly in the market and lower medical costs for <br>our citizens, To get wealthier in the medical sector, we need invest heavily in healthcare. In <br>the past, when there was a pandemic, our medical profession had several problems, and<br> many individuals expressed their desire to die.
